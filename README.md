## Description

The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js is used for routing, MongoDB is for the database, and the Mongoose ODM. Since this project is entirely back-end, a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality will be linked below!

## Installation

First, the user must install MongoDB and Node.js in order for the app to run!

Then, the user must install express using `npm i express` for routing.

Lastly, the user must also install mongoose using `npm i mongoose` for the Object Data Modeling library that connects MongoDB and Node.js.

## Usage
